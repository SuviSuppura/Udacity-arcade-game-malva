## Instructions

Use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/15/view) for self-checking your submission.

Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like `Player` and `Enemy`) or class prototype functions such as `Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions`. Also make sure that the keyword `this` is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon.

Your **README.md** file should be updated with instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

1. How to run the game
First save the whole package to a same location and check that you have folders for css, images, js. Then open the index.html file in you browser.

2. How to play the game
To win the game is to get the player (a boy) safely up to the water. On the way there will be enemies (bugs) which must be avoided. If you hit one of the bugs you will be returned back to the start. You can move the player with the arrow keys on you keyboard.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).
